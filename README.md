# Social-Media-Mining---Hateful-Users-on-Twitter

The introduction and   broad   use   of   social media platforms, such as Twitter, have revolutionized the communication landscape by facilitating global discourse, idea exchange, and information dissemination among users from a wide range of backgrounds. But these platformsâ€™ widespread use has also made it easier for harmful phenomena like hate speech and online abuse to proliferate, which makes it difficult to create a positive and welcoming digital ecology. Robust tools for identifying and reducing hateful behavior in social media settings are necessary to address these issues.

In this study, we introduce a thorough strategy for locating and evaluating hateful users on Twitter by utilizing cutting-edge machine learning techniques, namely Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). A complex framework for handling and modeling graph-structured data is provided by GCNs.

Making them especially suitable for identifying complex relationships and patterns seen in social media interactions. We do a comprehensive analysis of Twitter data, including user behavior, language indicators, and network architecture. Through the utilization of GCNs in combination with conventional machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Regression, and Naive Bayes, our goal is to create resilient models that can precisely recognize and describe hateful users by analyzing their language expressions and behavioral patterns.

We show the effectiveness and scalability of our approach in identifying and classifying hateful persons inside the Twitter ecosystem through thorough experimentation and evaluation. Our research advances the understanding of hate speech by illuminating the fundamental dynamics of its propagation and dissemination.
